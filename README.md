# History 
: Reason of post
Due to certain turn of events on an individual named "Reversed"/"Bryson"/"Spare" not paying me for the work I had done a year ago I think it's well appropriate to release my work for this project to the community. All work done on this project is made by me, be warned as there's over 10k lines of useless xaml due to my lack of organization last year. Changes maybe made to clean up this source. Feel free to use this source for your exploit if your capable of doing so. 

# Rogue Interface

The rogue interface consists of the "scripts", "settings" and "execution" tab. As well as the scriptcontrol (usercontrol.xaml file). Here's a video demonstrating the Rogue interface

# Questions

> Why are some of the styles so conky? <
Because I was unorganized and testing in the process of creating the source / design. Not everything in this is manageable unless you know what your going through.
